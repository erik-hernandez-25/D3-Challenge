# D3-Challenge

This webpage will show how to make a scatter plot between the data variable `Healthcare vs. Poverty` using D3.js 

The scatter plot represents each state with circle elements. The code for this graph you'll find it inside the app.js file. 
The data is pulled from `data.csv` and imported to JS by using the `d3.csv` function.

Note: You'll need to use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.
